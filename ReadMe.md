# IngrediMap: A Visual Recipe PWA üç≤

IngrediMap is an interactive **Progressive Web App (PWA)** that visualizes your recipe collection as a dynamic network. It's built to run on any modern browser, from desktop to mobile, and helps you discover new meal ideas by connecting recipes that share common ingredients.

## How It Works

IngrediMap creates a visual map of your recipes. Each recipe is a circle (or "node"), and a line is drawn between any two recipes that share ingredients. This allows you to see, at a glance, how your recipes are connected and discover new combinations based on the ingredients you have on hand.

## Features ‚ú®

* **Interactive Graph Visualization**: A dynamic, physics-based graph of your recipes powered by `vis.js`.
* **Mobile-First & Responsive**: A clean interface that works beautifully on any screen size.
* **Home Screen App**: Installable on your phone for a native app-like experience.
* **Offline Functionality**: Browse your recipes anytime, even without an internet connection.
